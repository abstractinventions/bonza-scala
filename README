A simple image proxy written in scala (mainly as a learning exercise).

Provide the port to bind to as the first argument.

Clients should execute a GET request to /i?u=<url>. The url specified in the u parameter will be fetched and streamed back to the client.

e.g.

http://localhost:<port>/i?u=http://images.url.com
